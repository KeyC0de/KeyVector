<hr>


A C++14/17 ready allocator_traits aware Vector similar to `std::vector` made for educational purposes with love.

Possible future endeavors:</br>

- `shrinkToFit(#)` : if current storage is larger than # Bytes, it shrinks it to # bytes
- `halfSize()`

I used Windows 8.1 x86_64, Visual Studio 2017, C++17 to build the project.
